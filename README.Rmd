This template was taken from Danielle Navarro's GitHub. In 'experiments' each technique/analysis has a 'data' folder with the raw files.
The 'data' folder in the root should have the cleaned data which was created with the files in the 'preprocessing' folder.

This is a template for a new research project. Should contains the following
folders: [analysis](./analysis), [data](./data), [experiments](./experiments),
[other](./other), [preprocessing](./preprocessing). Optionally, it may also 
include a folder `models` containing modelling files, and a `writeup` folder
containing the project writeup. 

If there are other resouces (e.g., OSF folders, Overleaf documents, Google docs)
that are linked to the project, they should be listed in this document.
